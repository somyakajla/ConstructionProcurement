# ConstructionProcurement
## Introduction
Construction Bidder is a construction procurement website where project owners can post project requirements and receive bids from general contractors. It follows a logical order as first, the project owners create a project and then send their requirements to contractors.  Next, the contractor sends out contract requirements to the project owner. They bid for the chance to work with a specific owner. Project owners pick the best one and then sign the contract with the project owners. Once the work begins, the contractor can monitor it to make sure that the contract is being followed. When the work is done, you close out the contract and fill out all the paperwork. This project is a kind of template which could be customized according to the project owner and contractorsâ€™ requirements. There is a lot of scope to enhance the functionality of this project.
